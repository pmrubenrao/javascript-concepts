# setImmediate()

## Definition:

`setImmediate()` schedules a callback function to execute after the current event loop phase completes, prioritizing its execution over timers created with setTimeout when both are scheduled at the same time.

### Key Points:

Executes after I/O events but before timers (setTimeout/setInterval).
Used for deferring execution without blocking other operations.
Example:

```js
setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('This runs immediately after I/O events.');
});
console.log('This runs first.');
```

Output:

```sh
This runs first.
This runs immediately after I/O events.
```

## Key Difference Between setTimeout and setImmediate:

`setTimeout`: Executes after a minimum delay.

`setImmediate`: Executes after the current event loop completes, prioritizing it over timers.

Illustration:

```js
Copy code
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout');
}, 0);

setImmediate(() => {
  console.log('Immediate');
});
```

Output:

```
Order depends on execution environment, but `setImmediate` typically runs first.
```
